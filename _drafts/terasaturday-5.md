_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in
the world of Terasology! Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._

It has been a while since our last update, the [GSOC 2020 - Conclusion]({% post_url 2020-09-27-gsoc-2020-summary %}), and even longer since the last **TeraSaturday**. 
So, some update on the latest progress is overdue! You may think that we all took some break after GSOC finished, but quite the contrary seems to be the case.
Since the release of [Engine 4.0.0 / Alpha 16 - GSOC 2020](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/tag/v4.0.0) there were **more than 120** <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-09-20..2020-11-19"> merged engine PRs </a> ü§ì and **more than 130** <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-09-20..2020-11-19"> merged module PRs </a> üëæ.
That's an average of >4 PRs merged each day! We'll try to sum up the major achievements below, but feel free to read through each an every commit message at your convenience üòã

A lot of these changes happened "under the hood" which means that, except for the obligatory new bugs üêõ, you as a player won't notice much of this. 
_@Michael P_ and _@Niruandaleth_ have been working on migrating our code base away from [TeraMath](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraMath) towards [JOML](https://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/), the Java OpenGL Math Library. We hope to reduce maintenance effort by using a thirdparty library here, as well as for potential performance improvements due to the best practices that come with using JOML.

_@immortius_ proposed to switch to [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) for models and animations more than a year ago (see [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3785](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3785)) and with the help of _@PAndaContron_, _@Qwertygiy_, and _@Michael P_ we eventually merged this to our main branch. Since then, _@Niruandaleth_ and _@casals_ have been working on the [glTF clean-up](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/4156), adjusting and fixing all the old MD5 models and animations in the game. We actually have quite a lot of those, we should definitely make better use of them üßê (and we already have some ideas on how to do that ...).

Finally, we also made the step towards [LW**JGL**](https://www.lwjgl.org/) thanks to the effort and contributions of _@DarkWeird_. This was initially suggested in December 2015 (now I'm feeling old ... üë¥) by _@msteiger_ (see [MovingBlocks/Terasology#2099](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/2099)) and just now became reality by [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3969](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3969). As with the other changes, you can see that everything is working if you don't see any difference to how it was before...

## Bug Fixes

- health regen
- ...

## Module/Feature Highlights

- cute monsters (incl. new custom model from quaternius)

üïπ Last but not least, you may enjoy this play-test video by _Lowricsec_ who gave the latest release a try. This has slipped our attention for 3 months, but here you go üéÆ
