## TeraCon 2019 - Munich Edition

Contributing out part to the big [Merge-athon]- out of competition, though. 

From Monday, October 14th, till Sunday, October 20th, we've [**merged 35
PRs**][PRs-merged] and [created 9 new PRs (or drafts)][PRs-created].

Monday, October 14
The first Terasologist to arrive in Munich is eviltak. After some hours of flight and an unexpectedly long time in the waiting line at immigrations, he is the first to check-in. Three hours later, skaldarnar and niruandaleth join him in the AirBnB after a five hours train ride through the country and stopping by the grocery store. After some short introductions and setting up the chromecast, we get to work: eviltak explains the new [AutoConfigPR] which replaces the previous [FlexibleConfigs], while skaldarnar and niruandaleth begin to cook spaghetti bolognese; soon the PR is merged and dinner is served - adhering to bavarian "tradition" - accompanied by a glass of beer ;) A bit later qwc also joins the crowd, leaving jellysnake as the only Terasologist still missing in our crew. The remaining evening is mainly filled with recalling the focus and extent of the tasks of previous years' GCI and discussing what we learnt from those years and what we want to do different for this year's GCI.

The second day of our stay in Munich starts with a nice breakfast outside on the balcony with scrambled eggs, toast and a lot of sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è. While eviltak goes out exploring the bavarian capital, the other three of us stay in to code. As skaldarnar and niruandaleth have to work for their day-job, however, the only one actually making progress with Terasology is qwc by cleaning up his server and the docker build stuff on it. In the evening we get together again to do a first playtest - well... try to at least. While qwc and niruandaleth experience some strange world generation issues when starting up Light & Shadow, the daytime adventuring through Munich soon takes its toll on eviltak and he (in his own words) "falls asleep basically right on his face". Eventually, skaldarnar and qwc manage to play a first round of Light & Shadow capture the flag. With regard to jellysnakes estimated arrival early next morning and the necessity of a good night's sleep to have a productive TeraCon, though, further rounds are postponed in favor of heading to bed early.

## Google Mentor Summit

The remainder of the week was reserved for the [Mentor Summit], hosted by Google at the Marriott Hotel Munich.
Unfortunately, _vampcat_ could not attend, so _skaldarnar_ dropped in and joined _eviltak_ and _jellysnake_  for the
fun. We were among 318 attendees from 42 countries! The 10 Google volunteers made a great job organizing everything and
giving us a great time - Thanks to all of you!

Meeting so many other open source enthusiasts was an exciting experience to us all. Be it fellow game developers from
[Godot Engine], scientists from [PEcAn] who study ecosystems from crops to forests, or tech-talk about Gradle and JavaFX
with some new friends from [JabRef]. But it was not only just talking - we tried out the [Checker Framework] on the spot
in [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3769], leading to a small improvement merged in [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3769].

Besides some fun activities such as a scavenger hunt through Munich or a castle tour the mentor summit is an **unconference**. There is no predefined schedule (beside lunch time, of course üçîü•ó) the attendees have to follow. Instead, everything is self-organized.
