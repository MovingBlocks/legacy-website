  <p>
    Terasology is a super extensible open source voxel-based
    game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming
    a platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the ground up, <a aria-label="Terasology on GitHub" href="https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology">Terasology</a> was built to be a modular and extensible game. 
    We host a large number of <a aria-label="Terasology modules on GitHub" href="http://github.com/Terasology">modules</a> on Github, and publish
    a playable bundle as "Omega" distribution for everyone to try out. 
    We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on our
    <a aria-label="Terasology Discord Link" href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>.

  <p>
    The creators and maintainers are a diverse mix of software developers,
    designers, game testers, graphic artists, musicians and
    open source loving high schoolers. We encourage and appreciate contributions
    from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to
    newcomers.
