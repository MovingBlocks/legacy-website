        Terasology is a super duper extensible open source voxel-based
        Minecraft-like game. It was born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo and
        is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay
        settings in a voxel world.
        <br>
        <br> From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and
        modular game. Currently, Terasology has over 150 modules under the
        <a href="http://github.com/Terasology">Terasology</a> organisation, and
        many more which are maintained by individual enthusiasts. We welcome new
        ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions
        from anyone and everyone, so feel free to drop by our IRC channel if you
        have any.
        <br>
        <br> The creators and maintainers are a diverse mix of software developers,
        designers, game testers, graphic artists, musicians and even a few
        open source loving high schoolers. We encourage and appreciate contributions
        from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to
        newcomers.
        <br>
