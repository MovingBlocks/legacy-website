  <p>
    Terasology is a super extensible open source voxel-based
    game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming
    a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and
    modular game. We host a large amount of modules under the
    <a href="http://github.com/Terasology">Terasology</a> organisation, and
    many more which are maintained by individual enthusiasts. We welcome new
    ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions
    from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on our
    <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> or IRC (#terasology on freenode).
  </p>
  <p>
    The creators and maintainers are a diverse mix of software developers,
    designers, game testers, graphic artists, musicians and
    open source loving high schoolers. We encourage and appreciate contributions
    from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to
    newcomers.
  </p>

    license for code and under CC BY 4.0 for artwork (see credits for some
    minor exceptions).
