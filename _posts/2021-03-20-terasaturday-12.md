_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in
the world of Terasology! Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._

## 📯 Terasology Alpha 19 (v4.3.0) released!

We are happy to announce that we just released Terasology Alpha 19 (v4.3.0).
While this release mainly consists of foundation work and "under-the-hood" improvements that are not visible in the game, our contributors also added a few quite visible goodies such as visual damage indicators (see TeraSaturday #11) and a world generation plugin for Flying Islands 🛸

## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...

Many thanks to our contributors since last [TeraSaturday #11]({% post_url 2021-03-13-terasaturday-11 %}): _@antag99_, _@DarkWeird_, _@keturn_, _@pollend_, and _@skaldarnar_.

After the preparational groundwork of the previous week, the _gestalt v7_ efforts of this week led to moving basically each and every package and file in the engine. As a result most of our omega modules had to be adjusted accordingly. A big thank you to _@keturn_, _@pollend_ and _@DarkWeird_ for their dedication! 🤗

Last but not least, since our recent JOML efforts we had a bug that resulted in the target indication box on a previously targeted block to stay rendered even when rotating the camera upwards so that it points at a block that is not within range.
We'd like to send out a warm welcome and thank you to our new contributor _@antag99_  who fixed this bug as one of his first contributions within our community 👋

In total, we merged [10 engine PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-14..2021-03-20) and [130 PRs on modules](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-14..2021-03-20).


## 🎀️ Community Highlights

- laputa + story
- JS issues + motivation
- wiki / docs / structure + explanation



This week's community highlight started off on November last year, when _@askneller_ opened a PR to add a "red flash" as visual indicator when the player receives damage ([Terasology/Health#53]).
We eventually found the time to follow-up on that, and push it over the finish line ([Terasology/Health#67]). 

From now on, you'll see a visual indicator when being hit. The indicator will hint at where the damage is coming from, e.g., show a flashing read indicator on the left edge of the screen when being hit from the left. 
If no specific direction can be identified, e.g., if the damage is due to thirst or falling damage, all indicators will flash up at the same time.

Let's end this post with a teaser for a TeraSpotlight post about our recent community pulse-check workshop that will (hopefully) come up soon: Have you ever thought about what animal Terasology might be? - We neither 😁 But then we decided to try... here's what we came up with.
