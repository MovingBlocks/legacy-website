***Heya Terasologist!***

The website is now set up to preview on request.

<div class="divider"></div>

<h5><b> What's new? </b></h5>

All changes to our splash site are made by sending over Pull Requests over to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/movingblocks.github.com).

Commenting with the phrase "Let's preview this" on a pull request now triggers our server to build and deploy the latest state of the pull request over at [http://preview.terasology.net/](http://preview.terasology.net/). 

When built, a bot named "gooey-splashsite" replies with "Preview is available on http://preview.terasology.net :rocket:" and the changes are reflected at the [preview site](http://preview.terasology.net/).
