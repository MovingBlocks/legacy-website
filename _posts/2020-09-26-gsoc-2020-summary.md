Our 5th year anniversary of inviting Google Summer of Code (GSOC) students into our community is over.
This year, we [welcomed](https://terasology.org/2020/05/30/gsoc-2020-students.html) six students to join efforts with mentors and other contributors to make Terasology even more awesome!
Two more students were working on GSoC projects for Coduino under Terasology as the "umbrella organization":

**Quick Reminder:** [GSOC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a 3-month program sponsored by Google that motivates students from all over the world to join open-source organizations and thrive on real-world software development challenges.
Organizations and students find and interact with each other directly and on a social and community-driven basis.

When our students were mid-way through their GSOC projects, [a lot of progress was already visible](https://terasology.org/2020/07/19/gsoc-2020-midterm.html).
Let's take a look what the final results of each project looks like üîç

# Metal Renegades: Refining Gameplay

This GSoC, our second year student _AndyTechGuy_ polished the technical backbone implemented last year into an improved gameplay mode called "Metal Renegades".
The main aspects of this year's work included adding new gameplay features to the module, refining already existing features, and fixing bugs that negatively impact the core experience.

Newly introduced features included discoverable places where the player may find food, tools or valuables and nighttime enemies the players must fight or avoid by busing themselves in town.
Improvements and fixes on the other hand targeted the market and trading system and its multiplayer capabilities, performance issues especially induced by city growth, and balancing the survival possibilities by making wells dry out after several uses and adding more food sources.

# Biome-specific Content Enhancements for Terasology
## - by _ktksan_

üëâ [Final Report (forum.terasology.org)](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/biome-specific-content-weekly-updates.2322/page-2#post-16881)

In their GSoC project, _ktksan_ introduced biome-specific content for biomes with extreme climatic conditions such as the desert and snow biomes.
To keep the gameplay balance, this content included negative effects on the player as well as ways to overcome these obstacles.

The negative effects affect the player based on their body temperature: if the player gets too cold they will show symptoms of hypothermia, e.g. movement reductions or frostbite damage; if the player gets too warm they will show symptoms of hyperthermia, e.g. increased thirst and heat stroke weakness in the form of reduced maximum health.
To lessen or overcome these effects the players can protect themselves with warming or cooling clothes, such as a woolen vest or an arabic thawb and carry additional water resources with a waterskin.
Additionally, players are motivated to face these extreme climate conditions by exploration objects like igloos and oases offering rewarding items.
