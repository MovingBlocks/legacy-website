In our 5th year participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSOC), we [welcomed](https://terasology.org/2020/05/30/gsoc-2020-students.html) six students to our community that joined efforts with mentors and other contributors to make Terasology even more awesome!

**Quick Reminder:** [GSOC] is a 3-month program sponsored by Google that motivates students from all over the world to join open-source organizations and thrive on real-world software development challenges.
Organizations and students find and interact with each other directly and on a social and community-driven basis.

Now that our students are mid-way through their GSOC projects, a lot of progress is already visible.
Let's take a look at what each of our students has already achieved during the first half of the project üîç
