In our 5th year participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSOC), we [welcomed](https://terasology.org/2020/05/30/gsoc-2020-students.html) six students to our community that joined efforts with mentors and other contributors to make Terasology even more awesome!

**Quick Reminder:** [GSOC] is a 3-month program sponsored by Google that motivates students from all over the world to join open-source organizations and thrive on real-world software development challenges.
Organizations and students find and interact with each other directly and on a social and community-driven basis.

Now that our students are mid-way through their GSOC projects, a lot of progress is already visible.
Let's take a look at what each of our students has already achieved during the first half of the project üîç

- base algorithms for continuous and discrete traits
- tinting items, i.e., changing the color items appear in
- integrate with other modules, e.g., by adding events to EdibleFlora and SimpleFarming
- breeding seeds (looking for blue raspberries, are ya? üçì)
- genetics of edibles (food and drinks) affect their impact

- unit testing! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


# Terasology Game Hud, Graphics Improvement & Gameplay Guide
## - by _Stefania Mak_

Stefania's project is all about improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) and bringing Terasology and its gameplays closer to a distinct identity and style. For this, they started out with [collecting references](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsLSXFFPDvMwemMR3ZqTxqqf0Nk73v28DbdmhpuuS_I/edit?usp=sharing) from various games with respect to HUD (Head-Up Display) structure and design.
To get more accustomed to how Terasology HUD elements work and can be altered, Stefania took the task selection screen of Terasology's "Master of Oreon" (MOO) and gave it a whole new look:

![MOO Task Selection After]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2020_gsoc_moo-after.png)
Although, there's currently only the default blueprint image shown in the task seelction screen, Stefania created a bunch more, to be integrated by any interested party on resolving https://github.com/Terasology/MasterOfOreon/issues/73:

After this first familiarization task, the focus went to Terasology's Capture-the-Flag gameplay "Light And Shadow" (LAS).
Here again, Stefania showed a lot of creativity with mock-ups for the different gameplay-specific screens:

Furthermore, they started altering more general aspects of the HUD, for instance by changing the quickslot bar from the classic Minecraft-like horizontal orientation and central position to a less building-focused vertical orientation at the right side of the screen:
