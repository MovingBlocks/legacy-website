_Please enjoy this special spotlight post about results of a workshop we are excited about. We hope you will like it as much as we do!_

## üóíÔ∏è Workshop Format

- workshop rules
- workshop expectations
    values and emotions, less technical
    figure out where we have a lot of overlap and where we don't
- icebreaker (animal area) üêæ
- self reflection
- clustering & discussion

## üî• Motivation

This first workshop module was all about motivation:
<ul>
<li>what motivates us to work on an open source project?</li>
<li>what made us join and stay with the Terasology community?</li>
<li>what factors demotivate and motivate us when working on Terasology?</li>
</ul>

### üêæ Contributor Spirit Animals

Each of us is an individual human being with different character, mindset, goals and dreams.
We act and contribute in different ways and for different reasons.
This is why, the first question we asked ourselves was: "Which animal do I feel like when contributing to Terasology?"

From ant to elephant, from whale to platypus, from peacock to ant-eater - the spirit animals representing us contributing to Terasology were as different as we are as people.
While some of us run around all busy, working on a lot of different topics and area, others prefer to contribute with large changes with long term goals.
Some even do both, being rather casual for a while and then bursting out in activity.
At the same time, some of us like to produce fancy, visible features and show them off, while others concentrate on "eating" bugs or work behind the scenes to keep the community going.

### üîç Project Requirements

Most of us already contribute to open source projects for several years and learned what we like in a project and what we don't.
In this light, we self-reflected on the following prompt: "If I'd start Open Source contribution now, I'd look for a project, that ..."

After writing down whatever came to mind, we found a hand full of clusters that sum up our thoughts pretty nicely:
**User Focus** - we value both, an existing user base and that we ourselves use what we work on
**Community** - a welcoming, open, active and knowledgeable community is as important to us as good organization and a low entry-barrier
**Potential** - it's important to us that we see the potential for growth and adoption by users
**Match to Interests** - we actually like it when topics, tools and technology we deal with at work and in our free time blend well and we can use the resulting synergies to improve and become more experienced
**Nerdiness** - we're drawn to interesting yet quality-improving tools and languages and technical challenges that give us the opportunity to grow

### üíö Terasology and Us

All these thoughts about what we would look for in a project if we'd start contributing to open source now, brings up the question of whether that's also reflected in why we joined Terasology.
So it was time to revisit what motivated us to join Terasology and the paths that led us here in the first place.
Further, we reflected on our relationship to Terasology - what Terasology as a project currently is to us and what keeps us bound to it.

The responses to the "I joined Terasology to ..." varied quite a bit, but still we were able to find a few patterns in our clustering activity.
While most of us participated in GSoC and stumbled upon Terasology in the process of looking for a suitable project to contribute to, others learned about it in different ways or, in the case of Cervator our project lead, were around from the very start.
The clusters of the previous reflection also showed up again here - many of us joined for any or multiple of the following reasons:

* to help realize the project's potential of becoming a game we ourselves (would like to) play üïπÔ∏è
* to enable others to build on it, create an alternative to Minecraft or just "have a frame to paint in" üé®
* to learn and improve our skills üéì
* to meet people with similar interest üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
* to work on something we're interested in ü§ì

Most of these are nostalgic memories on the positive intentions and expectations that led us to join Terasology.
So next it was time to be honest to ourselves and enter the present time and with it our current feelings towards our project.
The thoughts triggered by the "Terasology currently is to me ..." prompt showed a lot of love and heartfelt bond with Terasology, but also brought up a first taste of what we're unhappy with and what concerns us:

<div align="center">
    "Terasology is a <b>tech playground</b>"
</div>

Terasology is a place to learn and grow.
It offers a lot of different areas to "self-actualize", to experiment, improve and grow as a coder, as a software developer, as a person.
It also impressively highlights the intricacies of Java and Gradle and poses interesting programming problems and space for architectural discussions and design.

<div align="center">
"Terasology is a <b>tech demo</b>"
</div>

All these different areas for self-actualization and experimenting and our ambition to make everybody happy took their toll on Terasology's "state".
We are struggling and are in search of both an identity and a player base.
Frankly put, our codebase is quite broken and more a proof of concept than an actual game.

<div align="center">
"Terasology is <b>our drive & ambition</b>"
</div>

In the midst of all these challenges, the important thing is that we're still willing to continue working on it.
We are aware of the state of our codebase, but we still see the potential, we see what it could become one day.
So we continue to put in the work, fix bugs, improve architecture, documentation and code and try to motivate more people to join the effort.

<div align="center">
"Terasology is <b>our brand</b>"
</div>

Why do we even bother, you ask? Because we love Terasology.
Especially in the current "scary world of 2020/2021", Terasology for us is an anchor of stability, a refuge to code in and a hiding place from all the real-world mess.
For us, it's our main non-work activity and a regular part of our weekly focus time off the clock.
We consider ourselves a community of friends and deeply care for our project.

### "Yay"s & "Ney"s

Albeit all the love and care, naturally there's factors that demotivate us and slow down our drive.
The responses to the "When contributing to Terasology, I'm demotivated by/when ..." prompt brought to light both technical and non-technical factors:

* review load - efforts often stall due to PRs sitting around unmerged because nobody reviews them - and the few people that do review often don't find time for anything else
* lack of focus - our recent attempts to channel and streamline our efforts to finish more complex stabilization topics one by one instead of starting multiple ones in parallel that conflict or compete for resources are somewhat successful but we still have a long way to go
* complexity - the sheer size of our codebase requires constant upkeep and makes it hard to troubleshoot and understand yet easy to break things by accident
* lack of usability & adoption - being more of a tech demo and less of a game, Terasology lacks usability which results in low attention from players
* (inter-)personal issues - as an open and international community, there's always potential for personal conflicts due to poor wording or language barriers, cultural differences as well as differing opinions
* lack of time - irrespective of student, employed or parent, all of us would love to have more time to spend on Terasology

Fortunately, there are many aspects that counter these demotivating issues and motivate us time and again to stick with the project and keep it going.
In response to the "When contributing to Terasology, I'm motivated by/when ..." prompt, we collected the following factors that boost our motivation:

* technology - we love it to share interesting things, play around with new tools and tech and find a shiny new use for some piece of logic that's been around a while
* achievements - getting things done, solving problems, finally fixing "that bug" - improving and seeing how much we achieved recently is a big motivator for us
* responsibility - we don't like to point fingers, but we share the feeling that it's our responsibility to fix a bug we feel is our fault and this drives us both to investigate and fix it and to test our contributions even more thoroughly the next time
* activity & collaboration - we are motivated by working together as a team and more people join our cause allowing for even more progress and achievements
* appreciation - visibility outside of our community in posts and videos as well as inside of it when people enthusiastically share what they've worked on or that they tried something and it worked out nicely - this really makes us glow üòä
* vision - sharing the crazy dreamland ideas we have and getting everybody excited about what Terasology could become keeps up the spirit and belief in our cause


## üîÆ Vision


## üí™ Follow-Ups

- clustering as "middle-step" -> we need to go beyond that as
- documenting our "values" as a community and project (both values we already live by and values we need to improve on)
- documenting our goals and target audiences -> find a state of collaboration / common ground
- drill down on topics where we are in line -> leverage momentum of interest/motivation
- drill down on topics where we are not in line
- decide on target groups, put ourselves in their shoes (empathy map)
- possible future workshop topics: self reflection on codebase state, documentation, retrospective on GSoC
