_Please enjoy this special spotlight post about results of a workshop we are excited about. We hope you will like it as much as we do!_

## 🗒️ Workshop Format

- workshop rules
- workshop expectations
    values and emotions, less technical
    figure out where we have a lot of overlap and where we don't
- icebreaker (animal area)
- self reflection
- clustering & discussion

## 🔥 Motivation


## 🔮 Vision


## 💪 Follow-Ups

- clustering as "middle-step" -> we need to go beyond that as
- documenting our "values" as a community and project (both values we already live by and values we need to improve on)
- documenting our goals and target audiences -> find a state of collaboration / common ground
- drill down on topics where we are in line -> leverage momentum of interest/motivation
- drill down on topics where we are not in line
- decide on target groups, put ourselves in their shoes (empathy map)
- possible future workshop topics: self reflection on codebase state, documentation, retrospective on GSoC
