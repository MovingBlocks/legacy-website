The first hurdle of [Google Summer of Code][GSOC] is already over for our students, so it's about time to happily announce
that all ten students have passed the first evaluation. Yes, you read that correctly, we are mentoring TEN students
this year! We want to take the opportunity to thank everyone involved in the project, mentors, students, and every
contributor chiming in with ideas, tips, and tricks. You make this the awesome experience it truly is!

# The Projects - An Overview

To shed some light on the projects currently in progress I'll go through each and every one of them and briefly explain
its purpose. Some students have set up awesome blogs, interesting dev diaries, or are using our forum for communicating
progress. If you want to learn more about a specific project, just follow the provided links.

## 	Anatomy System and Genome Integrations
Arpan is working on improving the game play experience to bringing some more detail into the current health system.
Instead of a simple health bar, the project aims to add anatomical body parts (like head, arms, legs etc.) to creatures
and implement a Dwarf Fortress style health system which has effects on specific body parts (like a broken leg from
falling down a cliff).

The second part of the project deals with integration of the Genome module for genetics effects with other modules like
SimpleFarming and WildAnimals for breeding and mutation effects. This opens up a whole new play-style of breeding and
crossing animals and plants to retrieve varieties of specific characteristics.

Read more about this project in [Arpan's Blog].
