We are proud to present these year's student projects for the [Google Summer of Code].
We are happy to announce that we are supported by five students over the summer.
The students will contribute to different areas of our wide ecosystem: ranging from modernizing our web presence over world generation in space and on earth to gameplay improvements.
Read on to learn more about the individual projects!
